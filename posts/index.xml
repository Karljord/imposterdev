      <description>Impostor syndrome, also known as impostor phenomenon or impostorism, is a psychological occurrence in which an individual doubts their skills, talents, or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud.
I battle this feeling everyday, in my private and professional life. Knowing that this phenomenon exsists puts me in an ever greater doubt. Am I i really a fraud and I choose to look at this phenomenon as an easy way out.</description>

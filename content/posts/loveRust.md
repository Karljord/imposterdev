I've just realized that I love Rust. Before even working with it. 
I know, I know, I have yet met the bumps that will drive me insane. But for the last couple of weeks I have been watching 
tutorial after tutorial, introduction after introduction. And the love for it keeps increasing. I have not felt this
hungry to try out a new programming language in a long time. So now I'm just trying to come up with a good sized project for this. 
And I think I settled for a CLI that generates config files from yaml specification in another project I've built.

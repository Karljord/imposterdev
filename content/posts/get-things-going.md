To begin, it proved to be harder then I thought to maintain a blog, given this is the first real post since I created the blog. 
I think the main reason for that is simple, even though my intentions from the beginning was to write things here no matter if someone reads it or not. I find my self thinking: Who would be even remotely interested in reading that. 
Time to change this, form now I will have the intention of posting at least once a week.

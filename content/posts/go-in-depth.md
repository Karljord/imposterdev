When prepping for a short tech demo for introducing go(lang) to my colleague's I realized that it 
would be a fun challenge to write a blog series on this topic. How knows, maybe even record a videos series on it some day. 
I while back I listened to the go time podcast where the guest of the episode had written a book on the same topic. 
What really surprised me was his intent of writing the book, witch was to learn go. He even used his own book when he had to look-up how things worked. 
I will no become an expert simply by writing this blog series, but I think it will help me toward that direction. 
I have also realized lately that I am really interested in the inner workings of the tools and languages I use. 
So here go's nothing. Let's write a go blog.

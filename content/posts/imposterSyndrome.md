Impostor syndrome, also known as impostor phenomenon or impostorism, is a psychological occurrence in which an individual doubts their skills, talents, or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud.
I battle this feeling everyday, in my private and professional life. Knowing that this phenomenon exsists puts me in an ever greater doubt. Am I really a fraud and only choose to look at this phenomenon as an easy way out?

The main reason I started this blog is to sum up my feelings, experinces and things I learned along the way. Along with soultions and projects that I work on. In the hopes that it migth help myself battle this constant felling of underperforming.

I hope to some day look back on this blog and see that I really accomplished something, or not.

# About Me

## Who Am I?

Hello there! My name is Leo, and I am a software developer. I specialize in nothing or everything. I've been fortunate to work with some amazing teams and to contribute to projects that range from small startups to large enterprises.


## Skills

- **Languages**: Go
- **Frameworks**: Beer
- **Tools**: Hammer

## The Imposter Within

Despite the experience and the skills that I've acquired over the years, I often find myself wrestling with the gnawing feeling of imposter syndrome. Yes, you read it rightâ€”I sometimes can't shake off the sense that I don't quite belong in the world of software development, as if I'm an actor playing a role rather than a genuine contributor.

### Facing Doubts

Questions like "Am I good enough?", "Do I actually know what I'm doing?", or "Will I ever measure up to my colleagues?" frequently plague my thoughts. Whenever I am praised for my work, there's a little voice in the back of my mind that whispers, "You just got lucky this time."

### The Silver Lining

But here's the thing: imposter syndrome, while uncomfortable, also pushes me to strive for more. It's a twisted form of motivation, but it does keep me on my toes. It's a constant reminder to never get too comfortable and to always keep learning. 

## What's Next?

I'm continuously working to better myself, both as a developer and as an individual. If you'd like to collaborate or just have a chat about tech, life, or the paradoxes of feeling like an imposter in a field you love, feel free to.

Let's journey through the chaos and beauty of code together!
